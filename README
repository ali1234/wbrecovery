Workbench Recovery Partition
----------------------------

This is a startup-sequence and mountlist for Workbench Installer.
Put it on DH3, set boot priority -1. Select to boot partition from
Amiga boot menu (hold both mouse buttons on reboot.) It copies the
Workbench ADFs to RAD: disks. Then you can reboot and it will boot
the install disk from RAM. You can then install as normal. When the
installer completes it will unmount the RAD: devices automatically.

all.md5: md5 checksums of every file you need on Install:

C:mount is from regular WB3.1
C:md5sum2 is from http://aminet.net/util/misc/md5sum2.lha
C:TransADF is from http://aminet.net/disk/misc/TransADF.lha

ADFs are the Workbench 3.1 ADFs.

If you need to remake the all.md5:

cd Install:
md5sum2 #? all > ram:all.md5

Now edit the all.md5 and delete any .info files, and the 
entry for any previous all.md5.

If you don't care about verification you can delete the md5sum2 
line from startup-sequence.
